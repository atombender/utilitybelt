// Queue implements a queue that will grow as needed, minimize unnecessary growth, and
// can be safely accessed from multiple routines without introducing race conditions.
// If necessary, the growth of the queue can be capped to a configurable size. When a
// maximum capacity for the queue is defined, an error will occur if the queue is full
// and an attempt is made to add another item to the queue.
//
// A queue is created with a minimum length and an optional maximum size (capacity).
// If the max size of the queue == 0, the queue will be unbounded. The growth rate of
// the queue is similar to that of a slice. When the queue grows, all items in the
// queue are shifted so that the head of the queue points to the first element in the
// queue.
//
// Before an item is enqueued, the queue is checked to see if thie new item
// will cause it to grow. If the tail == length, growth may occur. If the
// head of the queue is past a certain point in the queue, which is currently
// calculated using a percentage, the items in the queue will be shifted to start at
// the beginning of the slice, instead of growing the slice. The queue's head and tail
// will then be updated to reflect the shift.
//
// After dequeuing an item, the head position will be checked. If the queue
// io empty, head > tail, head and tail will be set to 0. This allows for
// efficient reuse of the queue without having to check to see if the queue items
// should be shifted or the queue should be grown.
//
// Once a queue grows, it will not be shrunk. This behavior may change in the future.
//
// All publicly exposed methods on the queue use locking to protect the queue from
// race conditions in situations where the queue is being accessed concurrently.
// Unexposed methods do not do any locking/unlocking since it is expected that the
// calling function has already obtained the lock and will release it as appropriate.
